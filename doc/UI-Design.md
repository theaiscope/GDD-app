# UI Design

## General considerations

In order to speed up development and use common UI patterns found in Android applications, we decided to follow the [Material Design](https://material.io/) guidelines and use the tools and libraries provided with it, with minimal changes.

The color palette uses a dark green as a base to contrast with the blood samples that might be more in the reds. Also, green is usually a color associated with calm, reduces stress on the eyes and is a familiar color in medical environments.

The UI design mockups were made with Sketch, with the help of the [Material Plugin](https://material.io/tools/theme-editor/theme-editor-home.html).

Sketch version: 55.1

## Source files

The Sketch source files are located in the `doc/design` subfolder. There are 3 source files.

### 1. `AI Scope.sketch`
This file is the main working file and contains the mockups for these _screens_:
- Add New Hospital - Error
- Add New Hospital
- Logged Out
- Login
- Mask Editing
- Meta Data
- New Sample
- Take photo

The `doc/design/exports` subfolder contains PNG renders fo those screens.

### 2. `Material.sketch`

This is a Sketch library file generated by the Material Theme Editor from the Material Sketch plugin with a custom color palette.

(Import this file as a library in Sketch in order to continue editing the main screens.)

### 3. `material-design-icons-rounded.sketch`

This is a Sketch library file provided with the Material Sketch Plugin that extends the number of available icons that could be used in the main designs.

(Import this file as a library in Sketch in order to continue editing the main screens.)
