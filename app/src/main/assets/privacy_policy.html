    <p><strong>AI Scope Privacy Policy</strong></p>
    <p><em>revised in April 2020</em></p>
    <p>AI Scope is a non-profit project dedicated to building open-source smart microscope which uses AI to improve the diagnosis of the most deadly infectious diseases in remote communities.</p>
   
    <p>The AI Scope hardware is powered by a software that is currently being trained to detect malaria parasites in thick blood samples.</p>
   
    <p>The AI Scope software covers several applications dedicated to build a disease images dataset, train an AI algorithm and help to diagnose diseases using a computer vision and learning program based on retinanet object detection architecture.</p>
   
    <p>The AI Scope as a non-profit project is the owner of the website with the URL: <a href="https://aiscope.net/">https://aiscope.net/</a>. It also runs an open source directory in Github to <a href="https://github.com/theaiscope" target="_blank" class="external">https://github.com/theaiscope  <!-- <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> --><span class="show-for-sr">Abre en nueva ventana</span></a> collaboratively develop the AI Scope software.</p>
   
    <p><strong>1. Information we collect</strong></p>
   
    <p>We collect and process personal and non-personal data.</p>
    <p>The term “personal data” is defined by the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You can think of your personal data as any data that allow you to be identified or that can be correlated to you.</p>
    <p>“Non-personal” data cannot be correlated to any specific person. By anonymizing personal data, personal information may be converted into “non-personal data.” Non-personal data is not subject to GDPR.</p>
   
    <p><strong>2. Personal and non-personal data we process</strong></p>
   
    <p>The data we collect is processed in the course of the three types of activities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Machine learning for AI Scope software development, and</li>
        <li>Maintenance of the AI Scope website as the data controller</li>
    </ul>
   
    <p><strong>2.1. Data processed for software development</strong></p>
   
    <p>As of now, AI Scope software is in development stage. The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) behind the AI Scope software is being trained to analyze the pictures of thick blood samples using computer vision.</p>
   
    <p>We make sure that the images of the blood samples added to our test data set are completely anonymised and that no personal identifiable information is attached to the image. The AI Scope software is trained by processing non-personal data.</p>
   
    <p>Recording of the interactions within the apps are stored in an anonymised fashion. This is done to understand problems in and improve applications. The data is handled by the provider Smartlook (<a href="https://www.smartlook.com" target="_blank" class="external">https://www.smartlook.com  <!-- <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> --><span class="show-for-sr">Abre en nueva ventana</span></a>)&nbsp; and stored on their infrastructure. Recordings will be deleted as soon as they are not needed for the stated purpose anymore.</p>
   
    <p>Aggregated technical information about apps crashes, and analytics data about apps behaviour is stored in an anonymised fashion. This includes information about the device (Make, Model), the user’s location and stacktraces. This is done to improve applications. The data is handled by the third party provider Firebase (<a href="https://firebase.google.com" target="_blank" class="external">https://firebase.google.com  <!-- <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> --><span class="show-for-sr">Abre en nueva ventana</span></a>) and stored on their infrastructure.</p>
   
    <p>Data entered into the applications (images, masks, metadata) will be stored on Firebase (by Google). This is done in accordance with the applications’ purpose of collecting data for later medical analysis.</p>
   
    <p><strong>2.2. Data we process as the data controller of the AI Scope </strong><strong>website</strong></p>
   
    <p>AI Scope relies on its website (URL: <a href="https://aiscope.net/">https://aiscope.net/</a>) to showcase the project. We collect, process, and use your personal data and other data to support the operation of the AI Scope website.</p>

    </ul>
   
    <p><strong>3.9. Cookies</strong></p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>We collect information about visitors to our website in order to improve functionality of the website and understand the website usage through cookies and tracking pixels (a.k.a. web beacons).</p>
   
    <p>A cookie allows a web server to place a text file (e.g., a clear ID) on your computer or smart phone/tablet. Cookies are used, for example, to automatically recognise you the next time you visit our website. The cookie is sent either by the web server to your browser or is generated by client-side scripting (e.g., JavaScript). Cookie data will be stored locally on your terminal device and in most cases will be effective only for a limited time period.</p>
   
    <p>Cookies help us to work better and provide lots of assistance in the background to make the process of being our customer a lot easier for you.</p>
   
    <p>In the meantime, your browser offers extensive setting options to manage cookies. For example, you can deactivate cookies in your browser or limit cookies to certain websites. You can also program your browser to first notify you before a cookie is placed. You can also choose these settings on your mobile terminal devices. You can at any time manage cookies by changing the settings of your devices, delete cookies, or block cookies altogether.</p>
   
    <p>You can also visit our website even if you block cookies on your terminal device. If you block cookies, the display of our website may however be impaired and not all functions may be available to you.</p>
   
    <p>Tracking pixels are small graphics in HTML e-mails or on websites. When you access such a website, your access to the tracking pixel will be recorded in a log file. This allows statistical analysis, which, in turn, can be used to improve our Services. You can set your e-mail program or your browser so that HTML e-mails will be displayed as text only, thereby preventing the use of some tracking pixels.</p>
   
    <p>Here is the list of all cookies and tracking pixels we use on our website, including the purpose of processing and duration of storage:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>We put great effort and will continue to attempt to establish internal procedures to ensure that your personal information is both accurate and protected from accidental loss, unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure.</p>
